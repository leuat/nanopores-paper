\section{Method}


\subsection{Procedural noise}
\label{sec:perlin}

Procedural algorithmic methods for creating realistic-looking
fractal-like patterns have been around for more than 30 years. The most famous of these
algorithms is Perlin noise, first developed by Ken Perlin in 1982 for
use in the movie ``Tron''.  Perlin noise is a type of pseudo-random
gradient noise that mimics a Gaussian field, but at low computational cost. 
An improved version of Perlin noise is called Simplex
noise, which has several advantages over standard Perlin noise in
terms of scalability and speed.  


\subsubsection{Perlin noise - an overview}
An overview of the current state of procedural noise functions can be
found in \cite{lagae:2010}.  Perlin noise \citep{perlin:2002} 
is a band limited repeatable pseudo-random function
from $\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ that is computationally fast and has
properties which make it suitable for creating patterns that mimic
nature. Perlin noise is an approximation to Gaussian filtered noise
implemented as a pseudo-random spline. The algorithm uses a predefined
grid of gradients pointing in a random direction, where for any point
within a grid, we interpolate the gradients from the four corners. The
algorithm is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] For a point, obtain the four closest gradients in the grid.
   \item [2.] For each of the gradients, calculate the dot product
     between the gradient and a vector defined by the  the distance
     between the the point and the current grid corner. 
   \item [3.] Instead of linear interpolation $F(t) = t$, use a fade function to produce smoother interpolated values. Perlin noise typically uses the following fade function: $F(t) = t ^3 (t  (6 - 15) + 10)$.
    \item [4.] Obtain the final value by linearly interpolating between the x-axis and
      use this result to linearly interpolate the y-axis. 
\end{itemize} 
Simplex noise works in a similar manner, but requires fewer
computational steps, scales better in higher ($\ge 3$) dimensions and has fewer 
anisotropic properties. 

\subsubsection{Properties of procedural noise}
Standard Perlin noise is known for having several anisotropic features
\citep{lagae:2010}. Perlin noise also gives rise to a ``textile''
pattern in the $x$ and $y$-directions, which is evident from the upper
left part of figure \ref{fig:noise}, depicting 2D Perlin noise in
a single octave. The upper-right part shows the same node for Simplex noise,
with less obvious patterns. However, when combining several octaves,
as depicted in the two lower parts, these anisotropic patterns tend to cancel
out. In any case, for observations of weak gravitational lensing, these anisotropies would occur on much smaller 
scales than the typical resolution. 
In addition, we have calculated the statistical distributions for Perlin and simplex noise
with $\sigma = 0.2$, and have plotted the results in figure \ref{fig:properties}.
Each procedural noise method has distributions that are close to normal, 
but with some intrinsically shifted sigma and mean. 



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{noise.eps}
\caption{Perlin noise (left) vs simplex noise (right). Note the
  straight x-y pattern in the single upper Perlin mode and the less
  anisotropic simplex mode. Lower part: combining octaves tend
  to remove these patterns.}

\end{figure}

\caption{Normalized distributions of Perlin noise and simplex noise compared with a
  Gaussian distribution. Note how both noise functions produce
  near-Gaussian, but slightly different distributions.}
\label{fig:properties}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multiple octaves: creating patterns}
\label{sec:octaves}
The different octaves from procedural noise functions can be combined
to produce a wide range of nature-like patterns. A generic
N-dimensional procedural function $\Phi(\vec x): \mathbb R^N \to
\mathbb R$ could be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:procedural}
 \Phi(\vec x) = \Theta \Big(\sum_k \kappa (k) P(  f_s (\vec x,k) )) \Big),
 \end{equation}
where $f_s(\vec x,k)$ describes the frequency scale modifier (e.g. $f_s(\vec x,k) =
k\vec x$), $\kappa(k)$ is the octave amplitude (eg $\kappa(k) = 1/k$)
and $\Theta(x)$ an overall modifier (e.g. $\Theta(x) = x$ or
$\Theta(x) = \frac{1}{x}$). In a sense, $\kappa(k)$ is similar to Fourier coefficients. 
In its simplest case, summing directly
over the octaves with amplitude $1/k$ results in 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:perlinlinear}
 \Phi(\vec x) = \sum_k \frac{1}{k} P( k\vec x), 
\end{equation}
and produces an 2D procedural noise pattern depicted in the lower
part of figure \ref{fig:noise}.

\subsection{Model}
In this paper, we are interested in developing a model using Simplex noise to reproduce nanoporous structures that are as statistically close to actual simulations of porous media. For a given data set and a model, we wish to estimate the parameters that best represent the data. This is performed through a full likelihood analsys, where we in addition validate the model by comparing the radial pore size distribution $g(r)$, porosity and surface area of the system.  

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{model_examples.png}
\caption{Examples of 3D simplex noise structures in nanoporous media. Left image: low persistence (large scale dominates), middle image: medium persistence (small scales starts dominating) and right image: high threshold (more atoms are discarded). }
\label{fig:model_example}
\end{figure*}
We construct a generic sum over procedural noise octaves with the expression: 
\begin{equation}
  M_1(\vec x) = \sum_{\omega=0}^{\Omega} \psi^{\omega -1}   N\big((\vec x + \sigma \cdot \omega)\nu \cdot 2^{\omega-1} \big),
\label{eq:noisemodel1}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is the total amount of octaves, $\psi$ the persistence (scale falloff), $N$ a generic $N$-dimensional noise function, $\sigma$ a predefined random vector that removes anisotropic artifacts and $\nu$ the frequency modifier representing the initial largest scales in the model. For each mode, the frequency is thus multiplied, while the overall amplitude is damped by a given persistence. In the end, we simulate a large set of bulk particles without any walls, and use the noise function to remove particles that are not in a procedural void given by a threshold $\tau$. Three examples of this model are depicted in figure \ref{fig:model_example}, where we have used $\Omega=6$ ocataves and the scale is $\nu=0.01$ and cutoff $\tau=0$. The left image depicts low persistence ($\psi = 0.0$), where only the first octave dominates (corresponding to large scales). The middle picture shows the same parameters with a higher persistence $(\psi = 0.5)$, where smaller scales become more dominating. In the rightmost picture, the effect of the cutoff threshold $\tau = -0.3$ is shown.   


\subsection{Model Measure}
In order to perform data analysis on the model parameters, we developed a code that uses Monte Carlo Markov chains in order to produce samples for building the likelihood. Before doing so, we need a model measure - a quantitative method that characterizes the internal structure of the porous media. This quantity should be computed for both the original data set and the one produced by our noise model. 

Ideally, the model measure should pick up all geometrical properties that are relevant for the physical study of interest. For instance, pore size distribution and porosity are import for studying transport in porous media. Another such measure is the Distance-To-Atom (DTA).
The method used for calculating the porosity of a media is defined as in \cite{gelb1998characterization}, and we obtain the surface area of a porous media by using marching cubes triangulation to sum the surface area of the triangles. 

In this paper, we choose to use the radial pore size distribution $g(r)$ as defined and implemented in LAMMPS \cite{plimpton1995fast}.  \todo{skriv litt mer om hvorfor vi velger g(r)}

\subsection{Likelihood}
The likelihood $\mathcal{L}$ of paremeters $\theta$ of a model $M(\theta)$ given outcome $x$ is defined as $\mathcal{L} (M(\theta) | x) = P( x | M(\theta))$, where P is the probability distribution. In our model, we use the $\chi^2$ test to fit our one-dimensional measure from the data $\bf d$ with our model $\bf M(\theta)$. Pearson's $\chi^2$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2 = \sum_i \frac{ \Big(d_i - M(\theta)_i \Big)^2}{M(\theta)_i^2},
\end{equation}    
and the likelihood is thus
\begin{equation}
\mathcal L \propto e^{-\chi^2}.
\end{equation}
For a model with $N$ free parameters, we build the full $N$-dimensional likelihood by letting random walkers map out the parameter space through the Monte Carlo Markov chain method (MCMC). For each step $M(\theta)_n$ in parameter space, we calculate the likelihood for this parameter configuration. Then, we create a new set of parameters for the next step $M(\theta)_{n+1}$ by choosing new parameters randomly from a $N$-dimensional sphere around the previous parameters. The model also chooses a new random seed. We calculate the likelihood at the new step and perform the MCMC test: Accept the new step if $\frac{\mathcal L_n}{\mathcal L_n+1} \ge 1$, or reject if the value is lower than a uniform random value $\in [0,1]$.  

\section{Model verification and data analysis}
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{model_test.png}
\caption{Simulated mock data used for the initial model testing analysis. Input parameters are $\nu=0.03$,$\tau=-0.02$ and $\psi=0.6$.}
\label{fig:mockdata}
\end{figure}
In order to verify our likelihood code, we perform a model verification test on a mock data set with known input values. In this example, we only use standard simplex noise with three free parameters: the persistence $\psi$, threshold $\tau$ and scale $\nu$. We simulate a data set of $159 ^3 Å$ of $1 000 000$ atoms, and perform the cutoff given input parameters $\Omega=3$, $\Psi = 0.6$, $\tau=-0.2$, $\nu=0.03$. The resulting 3D structure is depicted in figure \ref{fig:mockdata}. 

We continue by performing a full MCMC analysis of the mock data with using a parallelised code running on a 48 core cluster. In order to produce 300 000 samples, about 48 hours was needed. The results from this analysis can be seen in figure \ref{fig:mockdataresults_pts}, where the upper panel depicts the marginalised 1D posteriors while the lower shows the marginalised 2D posteriors. The center and left image shows that the input parameters of $\tau=-0.2$(threshold), $\psi=0.6$(persistence) and $\nu=0.03$ are all reproduced well within $1 \sigma$.


\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=.99\textwidth]{mock_data_results_pts.png}
\caption{Results from the model validation simulation. The upper panel displays the marginalised 1D posteriors for each parameter, while the lower panel depicts the marginalised 2D posteriors. Note that all input parameters were reproduced well within $1\sigma$ (inner contour line).}
\label{fig:mockdataresults_pts}
\end{figure*}





\section{Results}
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{sio_porous.png}
%\caption{Simulated silica created with LAMMPS. The box is $159^3 \AA$, with $100 000$ particles, having been created by cooling an expanding system until quenching was achieved. Note the similarities between the pores here and in figure \ref{fig:mockdata}.}
%\label{fig:si2data}
%\end{figure}
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=.99\textwidth]{results_porous_full.png}
\caption{Results from the analysis of a simulated $159^3$ \AA $SiO^2$ nanoporous data set. The upper panel displays the marginalised 1D posteriors for each parameter, while the lower panel depicts the marginalised 2D posteriors. Best fit parameters from the maximum 3D likelihood suggest $\tau=-0.2$, $\psi=0.8$ and $\nu=0.3$.}
\label{fig:porous_results1}
\end{figure*}

We now wish to perform a parameter fitting analysis on realistic simulated nanoporous media. Using LAMMPS \cite{plimpton1995fast}, we simulate a $100^3$ \AA box of 100K $SiO^2$ silica particles at an initial temperature of $4500 K$, using the Vashishta-potential. After an initial period, we expand the box to $159^3 \AA$ and start cooling until quenching is achieved at about $300K$. The resulting nanoporous media is depicted in figure \ref{fig:sio2data}, with a porosity of $75\%$.

With the model described in \ref{eq:noisemodel1}, we perform a full likelihood analysis of the data set with the three free parameters $\tau$, $\nu$ and $\psi$ using $g(r)$ as the measure. The resulting marginalised posteriors are depicted in figure \ref{fig:porous_results1}, with best-fit parameters $\tau=-0.2$, $\psi=0.8$ and $\nu=0.3$ is extracted from the full 3D likelihood. We also display the radial pore size distribution $g(r)$ for the input data set, a best-fit parameter data set and a bad-fit data set in figure \ref{fig:gofr1}, to illustrated the sensitivity of $g(r)$ given the model parameters. Note that we are not able to accurately reproduce the structures of the $SiO^2$ $g(r)$ with our current model, but hope that we during future work will be able to produce another model that provides a better fit with this measure. 


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.55\textwidth]{gofr_plot.png}
\caption{The radial pore size distribution $g(r)$ for three data sets: the simulated $SiO^2$ input data set, the best-fit parameter data set and a random low-fit parameter data set. }
\label{fig:gofr1}
\end{figure}
Finally, we depict a comparison of the actual simulated input $SiO^2$ data set together with a representation of the best-fit parameters in figure \ref{fig:porous_vs_model}   
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{comparison.png}
\caption{Right side: A realisation of the best-fit parameters $\tau=-0.2$, $\psi=0.8$ and $\nu=0.3$. Left side: Simulated $SiO^2$ input data set used for parameter estimation. }
\label{fig:porous_vs_model}
\end{figure}

The porosity of the input $SiO^2$ data set is $75\%$, while the best-fit data set has porosity $77\% \pm 3 \%$, depending on the random seed. In addition, the surface area of the original data set was $\tilde 29 000 \AA^2$, while the best-fit data shows similar values with surface are ranging betweem $\tilde 28 000 \AA^2$ and $\tilde 30 000 \AA^2$.

\subsection{Some notes on the results}
It is worth to note that since we are chiefly interested in obtaining a set of parameters that reproduces a statistical correct representation of the input data, we are relatively free to choose parameters as desired. In the previous analysis, we selected a best fit threshold value of $\tau=-0.2$, but from the width of the likelihood it is clear that nearby parameters would also be suitable. However, the surface area is strongly correlated with this value, so even slight deviations (e.g. $\delta \tau = 0.05$) yields a relatively large change in surface area. 

In addition, we do not claim that this model accurately reproduces the pore structure observed in nanoporous simulations, as is evident from the radial pore size distribution shown in figure \ref{fig:gofr1}.
